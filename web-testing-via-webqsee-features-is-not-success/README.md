# web testing via webqsee: features is not success

[webQsee](https://webqsee.com/) is a browser extension with a broad set of free-to-use features for tracking and recording problems in web applications.

Our goal was to get feedback from the community on why our userbase isn't really growing since 2020.

During the conference, we gathered a lot of useful feedback, especially regarding usability of the product.
Thanks a lot to all participants!
