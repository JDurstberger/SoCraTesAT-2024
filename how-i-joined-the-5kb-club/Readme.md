## how i joined the 1kb club

[1kb.club](https://1kb.club) is a collection of very small websites. like the name promises, every one of them is smaller than 1 kilobyte.

i recently joined the club, and working with the constraint of 1kb and finding a way to fit something meaningful into it was a lot of fun. you can find my site here: [hi.veryunited.net](https://hi.veryunited.net). i learned quite a bit about CDNs, headers & how weird html can still be considered valid by the w3c, as long as it's html5.

my favorite of the bunch is clearly his one: [1kb.jorgeff.com](https://1kb.jorgeff.com/)
