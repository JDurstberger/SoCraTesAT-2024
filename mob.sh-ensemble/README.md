# mob.sh ensemble

[mob.sh](https://mob.sh/) is a Git wrapper and CLI tool written in golang to enable quick code-handovers in remote mob-programming.

Our goal was to solve [Haralds Issue](https://github.com/remotemobprogramming/mob/issues/445) as an ensemble and release the fix.

So we did.
